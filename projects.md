On this page I will post and link to all my future projects and applications!

## [Personal Web Desktop](../projects/pwd)
This is my Personal Web Desktop that I made during my first year whilst studying at the Linnaeus University.
It was created for the purpose of widening my knowledge about JavaScript and working with the DOM - aswell as understanding
how the browser works and operates.

NOTE: Chat-application is disabled, due to SSL-issues.

## [Colorify](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/colorify/khmkbmhcijchhbnbaadifbfjljkgfhhc?hl=sv)
This is my chrome plugin that I created during my first year at the Linnaeus University.
The plugin is a color assistance tool for Google Chrome - the main goal with it to help colorblind people when working
with colors. Seeing how colorblind people struggle with layout and design. This tool can help them.

## [Whiteboard](../projects/whiteboard)
This is something I cooked up while I was learning how to use jQuery aswell as broaden my knowledge about Canvas!
It is a simple whiteboard application that allows you to draw images aswell as save the image when you're done!
It also comes with some configuration, stroke-size, background etc.
