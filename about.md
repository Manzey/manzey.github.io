My name is David, I am 22 years old. Born and raised in Österfärnebo, which is a small "town" far out in the forest, roughly 6 miles southwest of Gävle.

Previously I have studied "El & Energi", with focus on computer science, I studied at the Bessemergymnasiet in Sandviken.
After that I had to complement my grades in order to be able to pursue my studies further, so I took a complementary year to get the proper knowledge to continue
on my path. And now I am here, studying at the Linnaeus University - UDM!
On my free time I enjoy spending time doing anything computer-related and it has been like that since I discovered computers, basically.
I have a burning desire to learn more interesting things about computers and its subjects.
