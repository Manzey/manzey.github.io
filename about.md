My name is David, I am 21 years old. Born and raised in Österfärnebo, which is a small "town" far out in the forest, roughly 6 miles southwest of Gävle.

Previously I have studied "El & Energi", with focus on computer science, I studied at the Bessemergymnasiet in Sandviken.
After that I had to complement my grades in order to be able to pursue my studies further, so I read "Basår" on the University in Gävle for one year.
And now I am here, studying UDM!

On my free time I enjoy spending time doing anything computer-related and it has been like that since I discovered computers, basically.
I have a burning desire to learn more interesting things about computers and its subjects.
